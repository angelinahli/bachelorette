# Note on collecting race data

For the purposes of this investigation, I hand-labelled a large amount of contestants based on their perceived racial / ethnic identities. My methodology was loosely as follows:

1. If I found a statement from the candidate vouching for their own racial / ethnic identity, I used what the candidate said of their own identity.
2. Otherwise, if I found a third party statement assessing a candidate's racial / ethnic identity, I used that third party assessment of the candidate's identity.
3. Otherwise, I would try to find a published photo of the candidate and use that photo to determined the perceived racial identity of the candidate.
4. In all cases, where I was successful in employing one of the above methods to determine a candidate's identity, I have cited the source I used.

## Potential Concerns

I fully concede that the above methodology may be vulnerable to some validity concerns. Here, I'll walk through some potential threats to validity and outline how I will address each one:

1. I could have selection bias in my overall data - I may be more likely to have race information for POCs as opposed to non-POCs, since the presence of POCs on the Bachelor/ette franchise has been heavily scrutinized by the media, and thus more articles highlight the existence of POCs than non-POCs on the show.
    * I agree this is a concern: Thus, I will omit seasons where I was unable to find the racial identities of all persons from time-series analyses.
2. I may be biased or inaccurate in my 'perceived' racial assessments of different candidates.
    * Certainly! In all cases where possible, I have defaulted to other people's assessments of candidates. However, I agree there is a concern that I may be systematically biased on my racial categorizations, one way or another.
    * One partial fix for this concern would be to more heavily rely on the overall POC flag as opposed to detailed ethnic/racial categorizations. This would solve for a situation where I systematically confuse people of one non-white racial category for people within another non-white racial category. However, the broader concern remains that, if I tend to confuse lighter skinned people of color and white people, I may be underestimating the number of POC on the Bachelor/ette.
    * Therefore, users of these data should note that these flags are more likely to capture *perceived* racial backgrounds than actual racial backgrounds.
