# Bachelor/ette Data Analysis

This repository holds the data and programs used to generate exploratory data analyses centered around exploring different questions about Bachelor & Bachelorette U.S. candidates.

## Why?

Because data is cool! Because the Bachelor franchise has become a cultural symbol worth exploring. Because I'm sad about Bachelorette Season 14 ending (Bring back #JoeTheGrocer).

## To Do
* Go over and check - is the data presentation as good as it could be for each tab??
* Perf - Over Time:
    * Do POC contestants stay on a longer percentage of the show over time? (Scatter probably)
* Polish the Notes section
* Finish index page
