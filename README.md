# Bachelor/ette Data Analysis

This repository holds the data and programs used to generate exploratory data analyses centered around exploring different questions about Bachelor & Bachelorette U.S. candidates.

## Why?

Because data is cool! Because the Bachelor franchise has become a cultural symbol worth exploring. Because I'm sad about Bachelorette Season 14 ending (Bring back #JoeTheGrocer).

## Questions
* 1. Does the Bachelor have a race problem?
    * How many people total are POC in the show? What percentage?
    * Evolution of percentage of POC over time
    * Evolution of total number of POC over time
    * Number of POC over time as compared to overall US level racial categories
        * IPUMS perhaps?
    * Number of POC compared to overall US racial categories - who is represented
        more and who is represented less?
    * Conclusions
* 2. Do Bachelor/Bachelorette's have racially skewed dating preferences?
    * Are POCs voted home more early than others relatively?
    * Are POCs voted home disproportionatelly in EARLY ('more random perception') rounds?
        * Might suggest that contestants are giving POC contestants less of a chance
