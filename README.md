# Bachelor/ette Data Analysis

This repository holds the data and programs used to generate exploratory data analyses centered around exploring different questions about Bachelor & Bachelorette U.S. candidates.

## Why?

Because data is cool! Because the Bachelor franchise has become a cultural symbol worth exploring. Because I'm sad about Bachelorette Season 14 ending (Bring back #JoeTheGrocer).

## To Do
* Rep - Comparison
    * Export census df to the right place
    * For each racial category in each year, find the perc of US population within that racial category, then find the difference.
* Rep
    * Create flag for 'season has all data'; allow subsetting based on whether season is complete

## Questions
* 2. Do Bachelor/Bachelorette's have racially skewed dating preferences?
    * Are POCs voted home more early than others relatively?
    * Are POCs voted home disproportionatelly in EARLY ('more random perception') rounds?
        * Might suggest that contestants are giving POC contestants less of a chance
